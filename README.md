# Portfolio
The front-end for my portfolio website, turpster.net

## Design
The goals for the design are of any portfolio, I want the design to reflect on my service; an easy, elegant solution.

- a simple theme
  - simple colours
  - simple font
  - simple icons 
- a slow, modern presentation-like theme
  - float-like animations
  - huge-elements to expand on click
